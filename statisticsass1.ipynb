    "\n",
    "# Quantitative Data: Numerical data that can be measured. It can be further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discrete Data: Countable data, such as the number of students in a class.\n",
    "# Example: Number of books on a shelf.\n",
    "# Continuous Data: Data that can take any value within a range, such as height or weight.\n",
    "# Example: Height of students in a class.\n",
    "# Qualitative Data: Descriptive data that can be observed but not measured. It can be further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nominal Data: Data with no natural order or ranking.\n",
    "# Example: Colors of mangoes (yellow, green, orange, red).\n",
    "# Ordinal Data: Data with a clear order or ranking.\n",
    "# Example: Grading in exams (A+, A, B+, B, etc.).\n",
    "# Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
    "# (i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E\n",

    "#ans-Quantitative (Continuous)\n",
    "# (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
    "# The levels of measurement describe the nature of information within the values assigned to variables. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nominal: Categories with no inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Types of fruits (apple, banana, orange).\n",
    "# Ordinal: Categories with a meaningful order but no consistent difference between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Class rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n",
    "# Interval: Numeric scales where intervals are consistent, but there is no true zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Temperature in Celsius.\n",
    "# Ratio: Numeric scales with a true zero point and consistent intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Weight in kilograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it dictates the type of statistical analysis that can be performed. For example, calculating the mean makes sense for interval and ratio data but not for nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If we mistakenly treat ordinal data (e.g., survey satisfaction ratings) as interval data, we might compute an average satisfaction score, which could be misleading because the distances between points on the scale are not equal.\n",
    "Q7. How is nominal data type different from ordinal data type?\n",
    "Nominal Data: Represents categories without a natural order. Examples include types of fruit or colors of cars.\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Represents categories with a meaningful order. Examples include ranks in a competition or levels of education.\n",
    "Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    "A Box Plot (also known as a whisker plot) can be used to display the distribution of data in terms of range, showing the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: Summarize and describe the features of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Calculating the average test score of a class.\n",
    "Usage: Helps in understanding the basic features of the data.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: Make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predicting election results based on exit polls.\n",
    "Usage: Allows making generalizations and predictions beyond the immediate data.\n",
    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The average of the dataset.\n",
    "Usage: Provides a central value of the data.\n",
    "Median: The middle value when the data is sorted.\n",
    "Usage: Useful when the dataset has outliers.\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value.\n",
    "Usage: Indicates the most common value in the dataset.\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "Usage: Shows the spread of the data.\n",
    "Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "Usage: Indicates how much the data varies.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.\n",
    "Usage: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the data.\n",
    "Q4. Categorize the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
